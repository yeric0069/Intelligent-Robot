Develop an autonomous mobile cart for object retrieval based on Raspberry Pi.
Develop an autonomous mobile cart for object retrieval, which implements motor PWM control based on Raspberry Pi. Precise speed and position adjustments, as well as straight-line motion, are achieved through encoder feedback combined with a PID controller. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is employed to fuse encoder odometry and ARUCO visual landmark data, accomplishing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for real-time pose estimation and environmental map construction. YOLO neural network is integrated to achieve fruit target detection, and target position information is obtained through visual measurement. Finally, the A* path planning algorithm is incorporated to achieve obstacle avoidance navigation and collection tasks.
